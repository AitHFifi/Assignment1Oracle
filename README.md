# Assignment1Oracle
Hereâ€™s another my assigment of a conceptual sql code for an E-commerce Management System. This will include tables such as products, customers, orders, and payment information.
I used the DDL commands to create, alter and drop tables; the DML to select, insert, update and delete data from the table; the DCL to grant or revoke access privileges to user(but I didn't use it); The JOIN to combines rows from tables in the database, where to filter records needed; and subqueries to retrieve data used in the main query.
